## Sunday
### Done since last update:
  - [x] Completed migration from 128-bit to 256-bit CIDs across core system
  - [x] Updated `constants.py`: Expanded all dtypes to 256-bit (4 × 64-bit components)
  - [x] Rewrote `keys.py`: E class now uses full SHA-256 with 4 components (high, high_mid, low_mid, low)
  - [x] Updated `wal.py`: Increased WAL record size from 64 to 128 bytes for 8-component storage
  - [x] Updated `store.py`: All insert/delete operations now pass 8 components (4 for key, 4 for value)
  - [x] Updated `storage.py`: Slot storage/retrieval handles all 4 components per CID
  - [x] Validated migration: All 10 tests in `test_datatypes.py` passing with full 256-bit operations

### Next up / To do:
  - [ ] Update remaining test files to work with 256-bit CIDs
  - [ ] Update ValueSet/VALUESET_DTYPE for 256-bit spill operations
  - [ ] Verify broader test suite compatibility
  - [ ] Update all documentation to reflect 256-bit CIDs

### Impediments / Blockers:
  - None at the moment

### Decisions Made:
  - **256-bit CID architecture**: Using 4 × 64-bit components (high, high_mid, low_mid, low) for full SHA-256 support and full IPFS compatibility
  - **No truncation**: Full 256-bit SHA-256 hash is preserved, no truncation to 128 bits
  - **WAL record size**: Doubled from 64 to 128 bytes to accommodate 8 components (4 key + 4 value)
  - **Storage format**: HDF5 slots now store all 4 components per key/value
  - **Component naming**: Consistent naming across all modules (high, high_mid, low_mid, low)

### Open Questions:
  - None at the moment
