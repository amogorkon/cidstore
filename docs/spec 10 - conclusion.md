## 10. Conclusion

This comprehensive specification integrates:

- **Core Purpose & Data Types:** Clear separation between semantic (leaf) and synthetic (internal) keys.
- **Node Structure:** Explicit HDF5 schema definitions for both leaf and internal nodes, including separate storage for keys and child pointers.
- **SWMR Compliance:** Use of copy-on-write, shadow paging, and global locking to adhere to HDF5â€™s SWMR mode.
- **Hybrid Multi-Value Handling:** Accepts duplicate keys directly; when leaf nodes overflow, multi-value keys are promoted to external value-list datasets to keep the tree balanced and efficient.
- **Key Count Tracking:** Dynamic in-memory tracking for efficient validation and rebalancing of internal nodes.
- **WAL & Deletion Log:** Coordinated mechanisms ensure atomic updates, robust recovery, and efficient batch deletion of obsolete nodes.

Together, these components form a robust blueprint for building a high-performance, scalable B+Tree tailored for triplestore backends, ensuring both semantic integrity and operational efficiency.
