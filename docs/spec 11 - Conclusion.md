This specification defines a production-grade, disk-backed hash directory system optimized for high-throughput, low-latency, and robust crash recovery. The architecture integrates:

- **Atomic Bucket Splitting & Merging:** All rebalancing is performed atomically using copy-on-write and WAL logging, ensuring data integrity and fast recovery.
- **Hybrid Multi-Value Key Handling:** Inline storage for low-cardinality keys, with automatic promotion to external value-lists for high-cardinality cases. ECC-protected state masks provide error detection and correction.
- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL) & Deletion Log:** All mutating operations are logged for crash recovery. Deletion log and background GC ensure safe, idempotent reclamation of orphaned data.
- **Concurrency & SWMR:** HDF5 SWMR mode enables a single writer and many concurrent readers, with all modifications performed using atomic copy-on-write.
- **Microservice Layer & API Separation:** All data operations are performed exclusively via a ZMQ data plane, using versioned msgpack serialization for efficient, extensible communication. The REST control plane is reserved for monitoring, configuration, health, and readiness checks (including the `/ready` endpoint). This clear separation ensures operational safety and observability. The system is designed for containerized deployment (Docker/Kubernetes) as the primary target, with seamless integration into modern observability and orchestration stacks.

**Extensibility & Production Readiness:**
- The design is modular, allowing for future enhancements (e.g., sharded directories, advanced caching, new value-set strategies).
- All maintenance, GC, and recovery operations are idempotent and safe for production workloads.
- Adaptive auto-tuning (feedback loop) dynamically adjusts batch size and flush intervals for optimal throughput and latency under varying workloads.
- All network APIs use versioned msgpack serialization for robust, efficient, and extensible communication.
- Comprehensive system-level and crash recovery tests, as well as robust monitoring, ensure long-term data safety and operational stability.
- Error handling and API versioning are explicitly defined to ensure forward compatibility and operational safety.
