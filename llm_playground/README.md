llm_playground

Purpose
- For the agent to experiment with the code without touching tests or main codebase.


Notes
- This folder is intentionally standalone. Keep secrets out of source control; `llm_playground/.gitignore` already ignores `.env` and outputs.
- Feel free to add more experiments, notebooks, or wrapper utilities here.
